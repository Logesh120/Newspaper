       <p>Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War (BLEACH 千年血戦篇, Burīchi: Sennen Kessen-hen), 
 also known as Bleach: The Blood Warfare, is a Japanese anime television series based on 
Tite Kubo's manga series Bleach and a direct sequel to its predecessor anime series of the
same name. In March 2020, Weekly Shōnen Jump and "Bleach 20th Anniversary Project & Tite Kubo
 New Project Presentation" livestream announced that the manga's final story arc, the 
 "Thousand-Year Blood War", would receive an anime project.[1] In November 2020, it was 
confirmed that the anime project would be a television series adapting the entirety of the arc.
The trailer and visual for the series were revealed at the Jump Festa in December 2021.[2][3]</p>

            <p>Over 1,000 Soul Reapers die within seven minutes of the Quincy's invasion. 
    Squad 3 captain Rōjūrō "Rose" Ōtoribashi meets Stern Ritter "U" NaNaNa Najahkoop, 
    Squad 6 captain Byakuya Kuchiki and lieutenant Renji Abarai face off against Stern
    Ritter "F" Äs Nödt and Stern Ritter "S" Mask De Masculine, and Squad 7 captain Sajin
    Komamura on Stern Ritter "E" Bambietta Basterbine. The other Soul Society captains 
    confront unnamed Stern Ritters. As the fighting reaches a stalemate, the Squad 2 captain
    Soi-Fon, Byakuya, Komamura, and Squad 10 captain Tōshirō Hitsugaya release their Bankais,
     but they are stolen by their opponent Stern Ritters using absorbing medallions. The captains
     are shocked by the news that the Stern Ritters' trump card is to steal Bankais, as it is 
   communicated to the rest of the Soul Society. Squad 8 captain, Shunsui Kyōraku is blinded
 in his right eye by Stern Ritter "N" Robert Accutrone. While Quilge fights against Ichigo,
 Urahara observes that the Stern Ritters failed to steal Ichigo's Bankai. Urahara opens the
 portal for Ichigo to enter there and join the fight. However, Quilge attacks Urahara, Orihime, 
 and Chad, and uses his Stern Ritter ability, "The Jail", to trap Ichigo in the Garganta, preventing him from reaching the Soul Society.
